# How-to-Eat-in-VR

## Description
**How-to-Eat-in-VR** is a simple Virtual Reality application created in Unity using C#. This project simulates the experience of eating in a VR environment.

The project focuses on the use of Unity's XR toolkit for VR development and incorporates various features such as handling 3D models, managing game states, and adding interactions like eating food items in VR. The Unity Asset Store's RPG Food and Drinks pack is used to simulate different states of food consumption.

## Technologies Used
- **Unity**: Game engine used to develop the VR application.
- **C#**: Programming language used to script the VR interactions.
- **XR Interaction Toolkit**: Used for handling VR interactions in Unity.
- **Unity Asset Store RPG Food and Drinks Pack**: Asset pack used for food items in the simulation.

## Installation
To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   
      git clone https://github.com/your-username/How-to-Eat-in-VR.git
      
      cd How-to-Eat-in-VR

3. **Open in Unity:**

    - Open the project folder in Unity.

    - Ensure you have the necessary version of Unity and XR Interaction Toolkit installed.

4. **Import Assets:**

    - Import the RPG Food and Drinks pack from the Unity Asset Store if itâ€™s not already included.
    - Ensure all dependencies are resolved in the Unity Editor.

## Usage ##

After setting up the project in Unity, you can start the scene and test the eating simulation in VR. The application allows you to pick up food items and simulate eating by consuming the items progressively until only the remnants (like bones) remain.

## Features ##
    
- Food Consumption Simulation: Interactive food items that visually degrade as they are "eaten."
- VR Interaction: Uses the XR Interaction Toolkit to handle picking up and interacting with objects in VR.
- Custom Scripts: Scripts for managing the state of food items and simulating consumption.
